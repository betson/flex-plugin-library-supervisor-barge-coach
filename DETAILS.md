### Details

This plugin adds a barge-in and coach button to the Monitor call canvas. You can get to this via the Team View, click on the agent you wish to monitor and the buttons will be available once you begin to monitor the live calls. The left button is the Barge-In button which allows you to join the conference all with the agent(s) and customer(s). Toggling this button will mute/unmute yourself. The right button is the Coach button which allows you to talk to the agent you are monitoring. The no other member of the call will be able to hear you except for the monitored agent. Toggling this button enables Coach and the left button converts to a Mute/Un-Mute button for the coaching mode.

Some additional features have been added to give the ability for the agent to see who is coaching them, and the ability for the supervisor to get into a "private mode" if they wish to not be shown (this applies to both the agent coach panel and supervisor monitor panel features). The latest version has added the ability for Supervisors to see who may be actively monitoring, coaching, and have joined (barged) the call. See the # setup and dependancies section on enabling the additional features.
